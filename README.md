# Code Refractor Challenge

## Description 

Adjusting a website's code to meet accesibility standards by adding semantic elements, alt attributes on images, and a descriptive title.

## Installation 

Visual studio code with 

* HTML
* CSS

or other application that has the 2 languages listed. 

## Usage

The end result will look exactly the same as the starter code 

![Start Screen](./images/ss1.png)

but looking at the html shows many structural changes made by removing many div elements and replacing it with more appropriate elements such as headers, navigation, and sections.
